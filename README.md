# Spectrum Data Science and Machine Learning Internship Project Report

## About the Project:

In this project, I have built a **Student Grade Prediction Machine Learning Model** based on the studentâ€™s data and previous marks.

I imported different libraries like
    
    1. numpy,
    
    2. pandas,
    
    3. sklearn,
    
    4. statsmodel.api,
    
    5. seaborn.

After that I preprocessed the data in the dataset, and changed the binary valued attributes into 0 or 1, nominal valued attributes into encoded values.

Then used various Machine Learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression.

And plotted the various insights from the model, I built.

## Future Development of the Project:

 1. Develop a web-application using flask api for taking input for the model and predict the output in the html page.
 
 2. Include a data-base to store the marks of the all the students.
 
 3. Track progression of the students and distinguish them into categories by their marks and priortise them as per the attention they require.
 
 4. Track average results progression by school-wise in district-level, state-level, country-level.

## Inferences that can be derived from dataset:

#### 1. Bar-plot that provide insight how the 'sex' of the students relate their 'final_grade' (i.e Gender factor)

#### 2. Violin-plots that show relations between how 'address' of students affect their 'final_grade' (i.e School Infrastruture/ teaching quality factor)

#### 3. lm-plot that provide insights on how 'studytime' of students affect their 'final_grade' (i.e Hardworking factor)

#### 4. lm-plots that provide insights on how 'studytime' of students affect their 'final_grade' differentiated by 'sex' (i.e Hardworking factor)

#### 5. lm-plots that provide insights on how 'studytime' of students affect their 'final_grade' differentiated by 'sex' with variations of 'school-support' and 'family-support' (i.e Support factor)
