# Spectrum Data Science and Machine Learning Internship Project Report

## About the Project:

In this project, I have built a **Student Grade Prediction Machine Learning Model** based on the studentâ€™s data and previous marks.

I imported different libraries like
    
    1. numpy,
    
    2. pandas,
    
    3. sklearn,
    
    4. statsmodel.api,
    
    5. seaborn.

After that I preprocessed the data in the dataset, and changed the binary valued attributes into 0 or 1, nominal valued attributes into encoded values.
Then used various Machine Learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression.
And plotted the various insights from the model, I built.

## Inferences that can be derived from dataset:

#### 1. Bar-plot that provide insight how the 'sex' of the students relate their 'final_grade'

#### 2. Violin-plots that show relations between how 'address' of students affect their 'final_grade'

#### 3. lm-plot that provide insights on how 'studytime' of students affect their 'final_grade'

#### 4. lm-plots that provide insights on how 'studytime' of students affect their 'final_grade' differentiated by 'sex'

#### 5. lm-plots that provide insights on how 'studytime' of students affect their 'final_grade' differentiated by 'sex' with variations of 'school-support' and 'family-support'
